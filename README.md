# DBus-cxx

## What is DBus-cxx?

DBus-cxx is a C++ wrapper for DBus.  DBus is a Linux-specific RPC(remote
procedure call) and IPC(inter-process communications) mechanism.  
DBus-cxx provides an object-oriented view of all programs on the DBus, and
allows an object-oriented way of exporting methods onto the DBus.
